# LynxGA
Atari Lynx hardware recreation

SCOPE:
To recreate the lynx hardware in a number of stage to both replace original hardware and recreated enhanced versions

Road Map:
1.  Create direct replacement schematics, that can be ordered and act as direct replacements 
2.  Replacement builds with low level fixes and failure mitagtion with existing errors
3.  Build enhanced boards that allow to HME, recharabel batteries and more screen options
4.  Recreate custom chips via programmable logic, improve logic with full decapped images
5.  Full recreate hardware in FPGA
